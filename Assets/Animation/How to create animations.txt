1. If the character doesn't have an animator, create an Animator Override Controller with the character's name.
2. Make the overriden animator the Unit animator.
3. Create a new animation for every type of animation possible linked to that character, rename them and insert them into each animation to override.
4. Create the sprites for the animations and generate the single sprites.
5. Open the character you want to add an animator to and drag the desired animator.
6. Open the Animation window in "Window -> Animation -> Animation".
7. Select an animation and drag the sprites desired for that animation.
8. Distance the sprites in order for the animation to not feel too fast nor too slow.
9. Do steps 7 and 8 for every animation and test the animations to see if they work as desired.
