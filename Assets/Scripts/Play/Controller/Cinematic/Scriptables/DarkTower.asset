    quotes:
    - name: Narrator
      sentence: Finally, our group caught up with the dark knight. Having taken refuge
        in a dark abandonned tower, the knight sought to destroy Franklem and his
        friends and finally bring Blemblemia down into darkness.
    - name: Narrator
      sentence: Dark incantations could be heard throughout the tower. A chilling
        voice pronouncing words from a language long forgotten, but whatever the sinister
        voice was saying, surely it couldn't be good.
    - name: Narrator
      sentence: Our group of heroes look tired, all but one, a young man seething
        with unending rage and a strong desire for revenge...
    - name: Franklem
      sentence: Finally we caught up with this rat! Let's destroy this foul creature
        once and for all and avenge the king!
    - name: Myriam
      sentence: Don't be reckless Franklem! We need you alive! Blemblemia needs you
        alive!
    - name: Rass
      sentence: I know how you feel my friend, but we need to be careful. This is
        the lair of the Dark knight...
    - name: Franklem
      sentence: You're all right...of course. Thank you all for coming. Let's get
        this done.
